Title: A dynamic visualization tool of multi-level data
Version: 0.99.4
Author: Katherine Icay [aut, cre]

Description: Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization
    of molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools
    and a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast
    and easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting
    downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules.
    The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML
    files that eliminate the need for third-party software to view.
    This enables a straightforward approach for scientists to interpret the data
    produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present
    relevant data.
